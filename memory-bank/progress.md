## Known Issues and Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. **Research Time Constraints**: Balancing thorough research with the 15-minute target completion time remains challenging.
2. **Source Evaluation**: Developing reliable methods to programmatically evaluate source credibility.
3. **LLM Integration**: Optimizing LLM usage to balance quality, speed, and cost.
4. **Memory Management**: Designing efficient memory systems for both short-term and long-term storage.

### Open Issues
1. **Performance Baseline**: Initial benchmarks from the research pipeline PoC show fast operation with mock components, but real-world performance with API calls and LLM processing will be significantly different.
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling strategy needed across all components, especially for external API failures.
3. **Caching Strategy**: Need to define optimal caching approach for LLM calls and research results.
4. **Testing Strategy**: Need more comprehensive approach for testing LLM-based components.
