## Active Decisions & Considerations

### LLM Strategy
- **Decision Needed**: Final model selection for different components
- **Options**:
  - GPT-4o as the primary model for all components
  - GPT-4o for reasoning tasks, GPT-3.5 Turbo for simpler tasks
  - Hybrid approach with Claude 3 Sonnet as backup for verification
- **Current Direction**: Using GPT-4o as primary with GPT-3.5 Turbo for search query generation

### Search Methodology
- **Decision Needed**: Primary search approach
- **Options**:
  - Direct API integration with search engines (SerpAPI, Tavily)
  - Web browsing with Playwright/Selenium
  - Combination of both approaches
- **Current Direction**: Starting with SerpAPI for search, with Playwright for content extraction

### Storage Architecture
- **Decision Needed**: Storage strategy for research data
- **Options**:
  - Pure vector database approach with ChromaDB
  - Hybrid approach with MongoDB + vector embeddings
  - Document database with custom indexing
- **Current Direction**: Using ChromaDB for semantic storage, MongoDB for structured data

### Deployment Strategy
- **Decision Needed**: Initial deployment approach
- **Options**:
  - Self-hosted solution with Docker Compose
  - Cloud-based deployment on AWS
  - Hybrid approach with cloud APIs and local processing
- **Current Direction**: Docker Compose for development, planning for AWS deployment

## Open Questions

1. How can we best balance research quality with the 15-minute time constraint?
2. What is the optimal approach for evaluating source credibility programmatically?
3. How should we handle contradictory information from different sources?
4. What metrics should we prioritize for evaluating research quality?
5. How can we effectively demonstrate progress to users during long-running research tasks?
6. What level of customization should we allow for research parameters?
7. How should we approach report formatting for different audience types?
